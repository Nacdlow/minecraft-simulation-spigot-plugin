# Minecraft Simulation Plugin

This is a Minecraft [Spigot] server plugin which connects to [Nacdlow Server]'s simulation API. It allows you to map
in-game functions to the simulator.  

This plugin is planned to map or mimic the following aspects of the simulation:

- Time of the day.
- Weather (sunny/rainy).
- The (main) doors and windows state.
- The light states.
